# netallocation 

A toolset for allocating flows and costs in [PyPSA](https://www.github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA) power systems. This package provides various functions to allocate costs among partcipants in a power network. Based on different allocation schemes, functions allow to allocate flows, losses and transmission costs in a transparent way.   


netallocation was initially developed by the
[Renewable Energy Group](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/physics/schramm/complex-renewable-energy-networks/) at [FIAS](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/) for the [NetAllok project](https://www.enargus.de/pub/bscw.cgi/?op=enargus.eps2&v=10&s=14&q=EA3310&id=399670&p=10) financed by the [German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)](https://www.bmwi.de/Navigation/DE/Home/home.html).
